# Automatically Label Cursor PRs
<!-- --8<-- [start:example]-->
Automatically apply labels to Pull Requests that are assisted by Cursor AI. This automation helps track the impact and usage of Cursor's AI capabilities across your development workflow.

=== "Label by AI Rules"
    Automatically apply labels to PRs based on Cursor AI rules, providing a data-driven approach to track developer adoption of AI tools without requiring manual input from developers.

    This solution automatically tracks AI tool usage without requiring developers to fill out surveys or take manual actions. Each AI-assisted edit is logged with unique identifiers in structured JSON format, setting the foundation for analytics across different AI tools while maintaining a consistent data model.

    !!! info "Configuration Description"
        Conditions:

        * A PR is created
        * Cursor AI was used in this PR
        * Cursor rule file was added to the repo
        * Changes to `.cm/ai.log` file are detected (this file contains entries for each AI-assisted action)

        Automation Actions:

        * PR is labeled with `ai-assisted`
        * Structured data about AI usage is logged for future analytics

    !!! example "`.cursor/rules/cursor-ai-logging.mdc`"
        ```yaml+jinja
        --8<-- "docs/downloads/automation-library/integrations/cursor/cursor-ai-logging.mdc"
        ```
        <div class="result" markdown>
        <span>
        [:octicons-download-24: Download Cursor rules file.](/downloads/automation-library/integrations/cursor/cursor-ai-logging.mdc){ .md-button }
        </span>
        </div>

    !!! example "PR is labled with AI usage"
        ```yaml+jinja
        --8<-- "docs/downloads/automation-library/integrations/cursor/label_cursor_by_rule.cm"
        ```
        <div class="result" markdown>
        <span>

        </span>
        </div>

    !!! tip
        Add `.cm/ai.log linguist-generated=true` to your `.gitattributes` file to ensure that AI-generated files are marked as generated content.


=== "Label by Survey"
    Prompt PR authors to indicate if they used Cursor for the PR and automatically label the PR if they did. This requires two separate automation files to handle posting the prompt and labeling accordingly.
